## So what is this?

This is a website I made for the Girls Who Code Verizon Newark @NJIT Summer Immersion Program classrooms. If you don't know what Girls Who Code is, go [here] (https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/). It's modeled after GWC Microsoft's website that showcased each classroom (or it **was**... it appears to have been taken down).

## What's on here?

It features a stylized picture of each student from the two classrooms @NJIT - Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper. Each picture is accompanied by the student's name and a quote summarizing their GWC experience! It's basically a pretty way to get a glimpse into how the GWC Summer Immersion Program impacts the people who go through it. Specifically, the high school kids in these classrooms.

## To Do

Yeah, so this isn't exactly finished. I mean, the purpose of making it is fulfilled essentially, but I want to fix and add things that will improve it. So here's what I want to do:
- [ ] Change the dropdown area so the cursor will only indicate the possibility to interact with it over the triangle, not the classroom name
- [ ] Add a description of GWC and this program either statically under the header or as a replacement for the grid when clicked
- [ ] Add a favicon
- [ ] Create a small footer
